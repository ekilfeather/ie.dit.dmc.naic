# NAIC App

The NAIC is a pure XQuery application used to display content from the National Archive of Irish Composers.

To deploy the app you require an eXist server freely available from http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/homepage/index.html

Just clone this repository into the eXist webapp directory and start the server.
