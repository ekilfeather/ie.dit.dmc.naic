  <div class="blind"><p>The National Archive of Irish Composers was launched at Gleeson Theatre, DIT Kevin Street, Dublin on Friday 26th November, 2010. Featuring instrumental and vocal treasures from the National Library of Ireland, there were several modern world premieres to be heard at this unique concert. The inspiration for many of the works on the programme came from Irish airs; the same theme can be seen in the accompanying Digital Library of historic piano music. Irish opera expert, Basil Walsh, listened to the concert live via the web streaming at his home in Delray Beach, Florida, USA and had this to say: </p>
      <p>“It was outstanding! The sound over the internet was excellent and the performances were just great. Your achievement represents a monumental step of great significance for current and future generations in Ireland and abroad, by making the music of classical Irish composers available for study and research through internet access. Something that was long overdue, and badly needed.”</p>
      <p>The music was performed by internationally-renowned Irish pianist, Úna Hunt who is also the project’s director, and students and staff of the DIT Conservatory of Music and Drama, Dublin. Introducing the concert was RTE Lyric fm's presenter, Carl Corcoran.</p>
    
    <p>The piano used for several performances is an original square piano, a popular domestic instrument of the period, built by Clementi and Co., and dating from c1809. Despite its name, the piano is not square but rectangular, with a key span of five and a half octaves. It was fully restored to playing condition by David Hunt of Cambridge in 2001-2002 and was kindly loaned for the launch concert by the Royal Irish Academy of Music, Dublin.</p>
    <p>The proprietor of the piano-manufacturing business that built the square piano was Muzio Clementi (1752-1832) who was a good businessman as well as a famous performer, teacher and composer. This instrument is particularly appropriate for performances of the works of John Field, Ireland’s best-known pianist and composer, as Clementi was Field’s teacher and mentor.</p><p class="link">You may download a PDF of the concert programme. <a href="sheet_music/pdfs/NLI_Music_Programme_v6_FINAL.pdf">Click Here</a></p>

      <p>Waterford-born William Vincent Wallace, composer of the opera Maritana, had an interesting life.  In 1835 he left Ireland and traversed the globe, beginning with a two-year stay in Australia, where he is still regarded as the first outstanding instrumentalist to visit that continent.  Crossing the Pacific to Chile, Wallace made his way northwards to New York and when he arrived back in London in 1845, romantic tales of his travels helped to attract audiences.  As a virtuoso on both the piano and the violin, it is likely that he was honing his extemporisations for several years as he travelled around the world, before committing his pieces to print.  In this piece, Wallace pays homage to Moore’s Irish Melodies by using the titles of Moore’s songs. <br />
